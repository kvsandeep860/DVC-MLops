1. create a git hub repo and clone it to the local
2. create code.py and and add some code it 
3. bascially we store our code on platforms like git hub bitbucket etc.. but for storing code also we need some platform one such platform
is aws s3, azure, google cloud etc..
4. The command to add the origin for s3 is 
dvc remote -d myremote s3(in place of s3 if we add the url of real aws s3 the operations will be done on those)
5. Every time we save the new version of data dvc will give a id which has to be tracked by git so that both git and dvc go hand in hand
